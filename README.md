# CSE 123 - Huffman Encoding

This is one of the projects I worked on as part of the coursework for CSE 123 at the University of Washington.

In this project, I implemented a Huffman encoding algorithm in Java. This code compresses and decompresses text files and optimizes storage by encoding characters based on frequency. I used a binary tree structure for efficient encoding and decoding, and utilized file handling to save and restore Huffman codes for future use.
